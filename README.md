# s2eclipse

The source of a Sonic 2 Master System romhack called Sonic Eclipse.
[More info here](http://sonicresearch.org/community/index.php?threads/sonic-eclipse.5524/)

This is slightly older than the last public build so it might contain some neat stuff if you peek into it.

Has my awful 2018 attempts at modifying z80 code. Please don't hurt me
